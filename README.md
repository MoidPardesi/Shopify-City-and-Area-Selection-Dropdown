**Shopify City and Area Selection Dropdown**

**Overview**
This project addresses a common limitation in Shopify stores that do not have a Shopify Plus account, specifically the absence of a city selection dropdown in the checkout process. I developed this solution for a client based in Dubai, where accurate area selection is critical for efficient delivery. Local shipping agencies in Dubai often require specific area information to ensure successful deliveries. Without this feature, the company would face the tedious task of contacting each customer to confirm their delivery area, leading to delays and potential customer dissatisfaction.

**Purpose**
The main purpose of this code is to automate the process of city and area selection within the Shopify checkout experience. By integrating this solution, Shopify store owners can provide their customers with a user-friendly way to select their city and corresponding area, ensuring that all necessary delivery information is accurately captured before the order is processed.

This solution is particularly beneficial for businesses operating in Dubai or any region where delivery logistics depend heavily on precise area details. By implementing this dropdown system, businesses can streamline their checkout process, reduce manual intervention, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**How to Use**

**1. Adding the Global JavaScript**

* Global.js: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for dynamically populating the city and area dropdowns, handling user selections, and redirecting the user to the checkout page with the correct shipping details.
* 
**Steps:**

* Copy the code from your Global.js file in this repository.
* Paste the code into your Shopify store's global JavaScript file or directly in the theme's theme.js file.
