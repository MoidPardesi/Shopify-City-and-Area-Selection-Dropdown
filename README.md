**Shopify City and Area Selection Dropdown**

**Overview**
This project addresses a common limitation in Shopify stores that do not have a Shopify Plus account, specifically the absence of a city selection dropdown in the checkout process. I developed this solution for a client based in Dubai, where accurate area selection is critical for efficient delivery. Local shipping agencies in Dubai often require specific area information to ensure successful deliveries. Without this feature, the company would face the tedious task of contacting each customer to confirm their delivery area, leading to delays and potential customer dissatisfaction.

**Purpose**
The main purpose of this code is to automate the process of city and area selection within the Shopify checkout experience. By integrating this solution, Shopify store owners can provide their customers with a user-friendly way to select their city and corresponding area, ensuring that all necessary delivery information is accurately captured before the order is processed.

This solution is particularly beneficial for businesses operating in Dubai or any region where delivery logistics depend heavily on precise area details. By implementing this dropdown system, businesses can streamline their checkout process, reduce manual intervention, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**How to Use**

**1. Adding the Global JavaScript**

* Global.js: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for dynamically populating the city and area dropdowns, handling user selections, and redirecting the user to the checkout page with the correct shipping details.
  
**Steps:**

* Copy the code from Global.js file in this repository.
* Paste the code into your Shopify store's global JavaScript file or directly in the theme's theme.js file.

**2. Adding the Area Selection Snippet**

* **area-selection.liquid**: This file contains the HTML and CSS for the city and area dropdowns.
  
**Steps:**

* Create a new snippet in your Shopify store named area-selection.liquid.
* Paste the content of the area-selection.liquid file into this snippet.
  
**3. Rendering the Snippet in the Cart Page**

To display the city and area selection dropdowns on the cart page, add the following code to your cart.liquid file:
**{% render 'area-selection' %}**

This will render the city and area selection dropdowns on the cart page, allowing customers to select their city and area before proceeding to checkout.

**4. Testing the Integration**
After completing the above steps, navigate to your store's cart page and test the dropdowns to ensure they are working correctly. Select a city, choose the corresponding area, and proceed to checkout to verify that the correct information is passed to the checkout process.
